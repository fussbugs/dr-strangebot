            <p>You finished this book hoping to avoid building Dr. Strangebot in your organization.</p>

            <p>You learned six decisions. Define the problem before touching the technology. Kill what needs killing to fund what matters. Learn cheap before spending big. Assign ownership with consequences. Prepare for reality's gap between pilot and production. Build infrastructure for adoption, not just deployment.</p>

            <p>Northern Star made these decisions. Some were right. Some were adjusted. But they were made. Clear decisions. Uncomfortable decisions.</p>

            <p>That's how you kill Dr. Strangebot in an organization.</p>

            <p>Now look up.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-16 mb-8 text-black">The Assumptions We're Making</h2>

            <p>Companies are racing to deploy AI that automates routine cognitive work. Processing invoices. Analyzing data. Scheduling operations. Answering customer questions. The technology works. The economics work. Deployment is accelerating.</p>

            <p>Here's the assumption buried in every business case: displaced workers will retrain and find new jobs. They'll adapt. The market will create opportunities. People are resilient.</p>

            <p>History says otherwise. We've never successfully retrained a displaced workforce at scale. Blacksmiths didn't become factory workers through training programs. They aged out while their children learned different trades.</p>

            <p>The new jobs being created? They require different baseline aptitudes. Different cognitive abilities that don't transfer in six months or six years. The accounts payable clerk doesn't become a machine learning engineer. Not because she lacks intelligence. Because she lacks the specific cognitive architecture those roles require.</p>

            <p>We're optimizing for efficiency today while assuming the people problem solves itself tomorrow.</p>

            <p>It won't.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-16 mb-8 text-black">The Scarcity Paradox</h2>

            <p>Everyone says: move into high-value work. Specialized skills. Creative roles. The jobs AI can't do.</p>

            <p>Let's be specific about what makes specialized skills scarce today. Take neurosurgery. Takes fifteen years to train. Costs hundreds of thousands. Requires specific aptitudes most people don't have. Medical schools limit seats. Residency programs limit slots. Scarcity is manufactured and natural.</p>

            <p>That scarcity creates value. Neurosurgeons earn well because there aren't many of them and demand is high.</p>

            <p>Now watch what happens from two directions:</p>

            <p>Direction one: Digital architecture catches up. AI can already read imaging scans better than most radiologists. It's learning surgical planning. Eventually it guides robotic surgical tools with precision humans can't match. The specialized knowledge that took fifteen years to acquire? AI learns it from millions of cases in months. Then robotics—phygital systems—handles the physical manipulation. The neurosurgeon's value came from combining rare knowledge with rare physical skill. Both are becoming less rare.</p>

            <p>Direction two: Everyone floods into the "safe" specializations. When routine cognitive work disappears, where do people go? Into the specialized roles. More people competing for medical school seats. More people learning data science. More people becoming engineers. Supply increases while AI simultaneously reduces demand. Scarcity disappears from both sides.</p>

            <p>The timeline? Unclear. Ten years. Twenty. But the direction is clear.</p>

            <p>Now the uncomfortable question: what is "high value work" actually?</p>

            <p>In mining, is high-value work the geologist analyzing core samples or the blast engineer optimizing patterns? Because AI is learning both. In healthcare, is it diagnosticians or surgeons? AI is learning both. In oil and gas, is it reservoir engineers or operations planners? AI is learning both.</p>

            <p>And "creative jobs"—what does that even mean? Are we talking about actual creative work, or are we labeling jobs "creative" to feel better about them? How many marketing jobs are truly creative versus executing templates? How many design jobs are creating versus combining existing patterns? How many strategy jobs are generating genuine insights versus analyzing data AI analyzes better?</p>

            <p>We're not being honest about what AI can and can't do. We're being comfortable. Comfortable is dangerous.</p>

            <p>The artisan economy is real. Hand-thrown bowls at premium prices. Custom furniture. Bespoke services where human imperfection is the point. That employs some people. Not most people.</p>

            <p>The math doesn't work for mass employment.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-16 mb-8 text-black">The Changes That Might Matter</h2>

            <p>Organizations can't fix society. But they can change how they deploy.</p>

            <p>Give people time. Transition over years, not quarters. Redeploy before cutting. Create adjacent roles. Most companies won't do this because markets reward speed. Some might.</p>

            <p>Make support real. Severance based on years of service. Retraining that leads to actual jobs. Income bridges during adaptation. Most companies choose cheap words over expensive support. Some might choose differently.</p>

            <p>Build capabilities, don't just extract. Develop people because better people create more value. Most companies extract until extraction stops working. Some build.</p>

            <p>Bridge universities to reality. Four-year degrees for eighteen-month job cycles doesn't work. Rapid reskilling. Continuous learning pathways. Deep industry collaboration. Most universities protect their model. Some might adapt.</p>

            <p>Create roles alongside automation. AI supervisors. Exception handlers. Quality reviewers. System trainers. Jobs that didn't exist before. Not every displaced worker fits these roles. Some do. Most companies won't create these roles unless forced. Some might.</p>

            <p>None of this solves everything. None of this saves everyone. But it might change the slope of the curve. Might create time. Might be the difference between managed transition and chaos.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-16 mb-8 text-black">The Choice</h2>

            <p>You can't fix society alone. Nobody can.</p>

            <p>But society is made of organizations. Organizations are made of decisions. Your decisions about deployment pace, transition support, capability building—they ripple. Enough ripples change outcomes.</p>

            <p>Or we keep doing what we're doing. Deploy fast. Optimize for quarters. Hope it works out. That's a decision too.</p>

            <p>Dr. Strangebot thrives on avoidance. On deferring uncomfortable questions. On hoping problems solve themselves.</p>

            <p>You kill him by making clear decisions. Decisions when drifting feels safer. Decisions that make enemies. Decisions with consequences.</p>

            <p>In your organization: make the six decisions this book taught you. Define problems. Kill what needs killing. Learn cheap. Assign ownership. Prepare for reality. Build adoption infrastructure. Decide: scale, stop, or stay. But decide.</p>

            <p>Beyond your organization: understand that your deployment decisions aggregate with thousands of others. How fast you move. Who you help transition. Whether you extract or build. These shape outcomes at scale.</p>

            <p>The future isn't written. It's chosen.</p>

            <p>By decisions made in meetings. By resource allocations. By what you fund and what you kill. By how fast you deploy and whether you help people adapt.</p>

            <p>Small decisions. Real decisions. Decisions that matter.</p>

            <p>The choice starts tomorrow. In the meeting you're about to have. With the decision you're about to make.</p>

            <p>Make it clearly. Make it honestly. Make it knowing that clarity kills Dr. Strangebot and ambiguity feeds him.</p>

            <p>Choose well.</p>
